# Day 15: Creating x, y, z Data for Heatmaps

In this section, we will focus on generating the necessary data points for creating heatmaps. The heatmap requires three dimensions of data: x, y, and z. 

## Topics Covered
- Understanding the structure of heatmap data
- Writing functions to process and prepare data for heatmaps
- Generating synthetic data for demonstration purposes

## Practical Exercises
1. Write a function to generate x, y coordinates based on a given dataset.
2. Create a function to calculate z values based on x and y coordinates.
3. Test the functions with sample data to ensure they produce the expected output.

## Example Functions
- `generate_coordinates(data)`: This function takes in a dataset and returns x, y coordinates.
- `calculate_z(x, y)`: This function computes z values based on the provided x and y coordinates.

By the end of this day, you should be able to create the necessary data for visualizing heatmaps effectively.
