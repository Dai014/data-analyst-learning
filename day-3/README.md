# Day 3: Decorators and Virtual Environments

## Overview
On Day 3, we will explore the concept of decorators in Python, which allow us to modify the behavior of functions or methods. We will also learn about type hinting using `Dict`, `List`, and `Optional`, as well as how to set up a virtual environment for our projects.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what decorators are and how to use them.
- Learn about type hinting in Python.
- Set up a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

## Practical Exercises
1. **Create a Decorator**: Write a decorator that measures the execution time of a function.
2. **Type Hinting**: Use type hints in your functions to specify expected input and output types.
3. **Virtual Environment Setup**: Create a virtual environment and install necessary packages such as Pandas and Flask.

## Next Steps
Continue to Day 4, where we will dive into the Pandas library and learn how to manipulate data using DataFrames and Series.
