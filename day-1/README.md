# Day 1: Basic Python Syntax

## Overview
In this first day of the data analyst learning journey, we will cover the fundamental syntax of Python. This includes understanding variables, loops, functions, lists, and dictionaries. Mastering these concepts is essential for any aspiring data analyst.

## Topics Covered
- Variables: Declaration and usage
- Data Types: Understanding different data types in Python
- Control Structures: Using loops (for, while) and conditional statements (if, else)
- Functions: Defining and calling functions
- Data Structures: Working with lists and dictionaries

## Practical Exercises
1. Write a function that takes a list as input and returns the maximum value in the list.
2. Create a dictionary to store the names and ages of five people, then write a function to print each person's name and age.
3. Implement a loop that prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

## Instructions
- Complete the exercises in the `basic_syntax.py` file.
- Ensure to test your functions with different inputs to validate their correctness.
- Refer to the Python documentation if you need clarification on any syntax or functions.
