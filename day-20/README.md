# Day 20: API Performance Measurement

In this section, we will focus on measuring the performance of APIs using various techniques. The main objectives for Day 20 are:

1. **Understanding Performance Measurement**: Learn about the importance of measuring API performance and the impact it has on user experience and system efficiency.

2. **Using `timeit`**: Explore the `timeit` module in Python to measure the execution time of small code snippets, which is essential for identifying bottlenecks in your API.

3. **Implementing Decorators**: Create decorators that can be applied to API endpoints to automatically log execution time, making it easier to monitor performance without modifying the core logic of your application.

4. **Practical Exercises**: Implement a sample API that utilizes the techniques learned to measure and log performance metrics.

## Practical Exercises

- Write a Python script that demonstrates the use of the `timeit` module to measure the execution time of a function.
- Create a decorator that can be applied to Flask routes to log the time taken to process requests.
- Test the performance of your API endpoints and analyze the results to identify areas for optimization.

By the end of this day, you should have a solid understanding of how to measure and improve the performance of your APIs.
