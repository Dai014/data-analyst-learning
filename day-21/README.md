# Day 21: Logging and Debugging in Flask

In this section, we will explore the essential techniques for logging and debugging in Flask applications. Understanding how to effectively log information and debug your applications is crucial for maintaining and improving the quality of your code.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to logging in Python
- Setting up logging in Flask applications
- Different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- How to log requests and responses
- Using logging to trace errors and exceptions
- Debugging techniques in Flask
- Best practices for logging and debugging

## Practical Exercises

1. **Implement Logging**: Modify the provided Flask application to include logging for incoming requests and responses. Ensure that you log relevant information such as request method, URL, and response status.

2. **Error Handling**: Create a custom error handler that logs error messages when exceptions occur. Test the error handler by intentionally causing an error in your application.

3. **Debugging**: Use Flask's built-in debugger to troubleshoot issues in your application. Familiarize yourself with how to enable and use the debugger effectively.

4. **Log Analysis**: Analyze the logs generated by your application to identify patterns or recurring issues. Consider how you might improve your logging strategy based on your findings.

By the end of this day, you should have a solid understanding of how to implement logging and debugging in your Flask applications, which will greatly enhance your ability to maintain and troubleshoot your projects.
