# Day 13: Using Plotly for Heatmaps

In this section, we will explore how to use the Plotly library to create heatmaps, which are useful for visualizing time data. 

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to Plotly
- Creating heatmaps from datasets
- Visualizing time series data using heatmaps

## Practical Exercises
1. Install Plotly if you haven't already:
   ```
   pip install plotly
   ```

2. Create a heatmap using the provided `plotly_heatmap.py` script. This script demonstrates how to visualize time data effectively.

3. Experiment with different datasets to see how the heatmap changes based on the data provided.

4. Try customizing the heatmap by adjusting parameters such as color scales and axis labels.

5. Reflect on how heatmaps can be used in data analysis and reporting.
