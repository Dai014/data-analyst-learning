# Day 16: Heatmap Data Optimization

In this section, we will focus on optimizing the data used for heatmaps. This includes techniques for limiting the number of data points and handling missing data effectively.

## Topics Covered
- Strategies for reducing the size of datasets for heatmap generation.
- Techniques for handling missing data to ensure accurate visualizations.
- Best practices for preparing x, y, z data for heatmaps.

## Practical Exercises
1. Implement functions to limit the number of data points used in heatmap generation.
2. Create methods to identify and handle missing data in your datasets.
3. Optimize the data processing pipeline to improve performance when generating heatmaps.

By the end of this day, you should have a solid understanding of how to prepare and optimize data for effective heatmap visualizations.
