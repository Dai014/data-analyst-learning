# Day 18-19: gRPC and Flask Integration

In this section, we will explore how to integrate gRPC with Flask to create efficient APIs. gRPC is a high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that can handle multiple programming languages and is designed for low-latency communication.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to gRPC
- Setting up gRPC with Flask
- Creating gRPC services
- Handling requests and responses
- Practical examples of gRPC integration

## Practical Exercises
1. **gRPC Service Creation**: Create a simple gRPC service that returns a greeting message.
2. **Flask Integration**: Integrate the gRPC service with a Flask application and expose it through an API endpoint.
3. **Testing the gRPC API**: Write tests to ensure the gRPC service works as expected when called from the Flask application.

By the end of these two days, you will have a solid understanding of how to leverage gRPC within your Flask applications, enhancing the performance and scalability of your APIs.
