# Day 10: Flask and Pandas Integration

In this section, we will explore how to integrate Flask with the Pandas library. The main objective is to demonstrate how to read data from CSV files using Pandas and return the processed data as JSON responses in a Flask application.

## Topics Covered
- Setting up a Flask application
- Reading CSV files using Pandas
- Returning JSON responses from Flask
- Handling data processing with Pandas

## Practical Exercises
1. Create a Flask route that reads a CSV file using Pandas.
2. Process the data to extract relevant information.
3. Return the processed data as a JSON response.

## Example Code
Refer to the `flask_pandas_integration.py` file for a complete example of how to implement these concepts in your Flask application.
