# Day 14: Flask and Plotly Integration

In this section, we will explore how to integrate Plotly into a Flask application to create interactive heatmaps. This integration allows us to visualize data dynamically and provide a more engaging user experience.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to Plotly and its capabilities for data visualization.
- Setting up a Flask application to serve Plotly visualizations.
- Creating interactive heatmaps using Plotly.
- Handling data input and output between Flask and Plotly.

## Practical Exercises
1. **Create a Flask application** that serves a heatmap using Plotly.
2. **Implement data processing** to prepare the data for visualization.
3. **Test the interactive features** of the heatmap in the web application.

By the end of this day, you should be able to create a basic Flask application that integrates Plotly for visualizing data in the form of heatmaps.
