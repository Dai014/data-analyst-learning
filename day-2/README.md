# Day 2: File Handling and DateTime Operations

## Overview
On Day 2, we will focus on two main topics: file handling in Python and working with the `datetime` library. You will learn how to read and write data from CSV and JSON files, as well as how to manipulate dates and perform mathematical operations related to time.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to handle files in Python, including reading from and writing to CSV and JSON formats.
- Learn to use the `datetime` library for date manipulation and calculations.
- Practice writing functions that process data from files and perform date-related operations.

## Practical Exercises
1. **File Handling**: 
   - Write a Python script to read data from a CSV file and print its contents.
   - Create a function to write data to a JSON file.

2. **DateTime Operations**:
   - Write a script that uses the `datetime` library to calculate the difference between two dates.
   - Create a function that formats a date into a specific string format.

## Files Included
- `file_handling.py`: Demonstrates file handling techniques.
- `datetime_math.py`: Introduces the `datetime` library and its usage.
