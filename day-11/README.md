# Day 11: JSON Handling and Logging

## Overview
In this section, we will focus on two important topics: handling JSON data and implementing logging in Python applications. 

### Topics Covered
1. **JSON Handling**: 
   - Understanding JSON format
   - Parsing JSON data
   - Generating JSON data from Python objects

2. **Logging**:
   - Importance of logging in applications
   - Setting up logging in Python
   - Logging different levels of messages (info, warning, error)

## Practical Exercises
1. Write a Python script to read a JSON file, parse its contents, and print specific data.
2. Implement logging in your application to track events and errors. Create a log file to store these logs.
3. Modify your JSON handling script to log any errors encountered during the parsing process.

## Next Steps
In the following days, we will explore internationalization in Flask applications and how to create multilingual support.
