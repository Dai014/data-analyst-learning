# Day 6: Advanced Data Operations in Pandas

In this section, we will explore advanced data operations using the Pandas library. The focus will be on techniques such as `groupby`, `merge`, and handling missing data.

## Topics Covered
- **GroupBy Operations**: Learn how to group data based on certain criteria and perform aggregate functions.
- **Merging DataFrames**: Understand how to combine multiple DataFrames using different types of joins.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Explore methods to identify and handle missing values in your datasets.

## Practical Exercises
1. **GroupBy Exercise**: Load a dataset and perform groupby operations to calculate summary statistics.
2. **Merge Exercise**: Combine two DataFrames using different merge strategies and analyze the results.
3. **Missing Data Exercise**: Identify missing values in a dataset and apply techniques to fill or drop them.
