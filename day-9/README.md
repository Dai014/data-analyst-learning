# Day 9: Flask Blueprint Structure

In this section, we will explore how to organize a Flask application using Blueprints. Blueprints allow you to structure your application into modular components, making it easier to manage and scale.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to Flask Blueprints
- Creating and registering Blueprints
- Organizing routes and views
- Using templates with Blueprints

## Practical Exercises
1. Create a new Blueprint for a specific feature of your application.
2. Define routes within the Blueprint and link them to views.
3. Use templates to render HTML pages from within the Blueprint.
4. Register the Blueprint in your main application file.

By the end of this day, you should have a solid understanding of how to use Blueprints to structure your Flask applications effectively.
