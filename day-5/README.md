# Day 5: Time Data Processing

## Overview
In this section, we will focus on processing time-related data. You will learn how to manipulate time zones, format dates, and create summary columns based on time data. This is essential for analyzing datasets that include timestamps and for performing time series analysis.

## Topics Covered
- Converting time zones
- Formatting dates
- Creating summary columns (e.g., hour, day, week)

## Practical Exercises
1. Write a function to convert timestamps from one time zone to another.
2. Create a function that formats dates into a more readable format.
3. Implement a function that generates summary columns from a given dataset, extracting information such as the hour, day of the week, and month from timestamps.

## Example
Refer to the `time_data_processing.py` file for code examples and implementations related to the topics covered in this section.
